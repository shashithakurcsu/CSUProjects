# This is a Python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers.
# Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2).
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
#Add them together to find the output. 
num_added = num1 + num2
#Subtract the two numbers to find the output.
num_substracted = num1 - num2

# Display the results
print(f"Addition result: {num1} + {num2} = {num_added}")
print(f"Subtraction result: {num1} - {num2} = {num_substracted}")

# End of program
